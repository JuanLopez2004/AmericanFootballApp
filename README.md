Let's just forget everything said
And everything we did
Best friends and better halves
Goodbyes
And the autumn night when we realized
We were falling out of love
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said
But we never did
Not to be overly (overly)
Dramatic
I just think it's best
'Cause you can't miss what you forget
So, let's just pretend
Everything and anything
Between you and me
Was never meant
Was never meant
